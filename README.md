** bn0055_accel_gyro_fusion_pub.cpp
** ROS publisher node for bn0055 absolute orientation sensor
**
** written for using the bn0055 in uart serial mode with a
** Raspberry pi UART pins 14 and 15 enabled - using the pigpiod
** C-interface. The Pigpio daemon must be running (sudo pigpiod)
** See http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpiod.html for more info
** Much thanks to Joan for her work on the Pigpio libraries and
** support on various forums.
**
** Should work via USB serial (with FTDI USB-TTL or similar converter)
** by simply changing the const std::string SERIAL_PORT in bn0055.h
** Currently, this works in accel/gyro only fusion mode but plans are to add
** 9DOF mode that fuses the magnetometer data as well.
**
** This is an early alpha version, written to be relatively simple to follow
** as an accompaniment to the book Practical Robotics in C++ by myself, but
** further development and config options are planned.
** Follow facebook.com/practicalrobotics for the book release and extra robotics content.
**
** 1111 is used as an error code in several places
